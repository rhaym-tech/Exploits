### MobileSlideShow iOS 12 type confusion vulnerability
### Created by Ukren Software on 09/25/2018.
### Licensed under the MIT License
### This is a 0day at this time

### DESCRIPTION
###
### MobileSlideshow (Photos app) uses a propertylist for loading the amplification metadata of photos.
### This propertylist is accessible and read/write/delete through the AFC service
### An attacker can corrupt the memory of MobileSlideShow by specifying a different type in the modifications value of the file.
### MobileSlideShow will read this information out at load, thus memory corruption occurs
### Because this read is done upon initialization of iBooks this is persistant after reboots and occurs immediately when opening iBooks.
### The issue can be resolved by moving the plist file to a directory inside a sandboxed bundle container that is not accessible.
