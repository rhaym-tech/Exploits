### assetsd iOS 12.1 type confusion vulnerability / persistant DoS
### Created by Rhaym Jailbreaker 09/25/2018.
### Licensed under the MIT License
### This is a 0day at this time

### DESCRIPTION
###
### , MediaAnalyzer, MobileSlideshow all use metadata information.
### This metadata is stored in propertylists in /var/mobile/Media which is a path accessible through the AFC protocol over USB.
### An attacker can thus modify this file and reupload it to the victims device, but a requirement is to have a paired device
### Unlike the iBooks vulnerability this vulnerability does not require userinteraction
### It is perfectly exploitable for race conditions as the assetsd service is restarted automatically upon crash and the bug will occur again
### I modified the type of the location key-values in the MomentAnalyzerData propertylist, but this is certainly not the only way to exploit it.
